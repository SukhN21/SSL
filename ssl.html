                <h2>What is SSL</h2>
                <p>
                    SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer. It’s a security protocol designed to provide encrypted communication over a 
                    network, most commonly used for securing data exchanged between web browsers and servers. SSL encrypts the data 
                    transmitted between your browser and the website you’re visiting, making it difficult for anyone to intercept or 
                    read the information.  SSL also ensures that the website you’re communicating with is the legitimate site you think 
                    it is. It uses digital certificates issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) to verify the identity of the 
                    website. SSL helps ensure that the data sent and received hasn’t been tampered with during transmission.
                </p>
                <h2>What is TLS</h2>
                <p>
                    TLS, or Transport Layer Security, is the successor to SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). It's a cryptographic protocol 
                    designed to provide secure communication over a network. It also uses digital certificates to authenticate the 
                    identity of the server. TLS is more secure than SSL because it incorporates improvements and fixes vulnerabilities 
                    found in SSL. TLS provides mechanisms to ensure that the data has not been altered during transmission.

                <h2>How can I tell that my webpage is secure?</h2>
                <p>
                    A secure webpage is one that implements various measures to protect data, ensure privacy, and maintain integrity 
                    during transmission.

                                <strong>Encryption:</strong> The data transmitted between the user's browser and the web server is 
                                encrypted using TLS or SSL.

                <p>
                    To be secure means to be protected against various threats, vulnerabilities, and risks. This concept applies 
                    across many contexts.

                <h2>What is encryption and why do I care?</h2>
                <p>
                    Encryption is a process that transforms readable data into an unreadable format using a cryptographic algorithm 
                    and a key. This transformation makes it difficult for unauthorized parties to access or understand the original data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You should care about encryption because it plays a critical role in protecting your personal information and 
                    maintaining your privacy in the digital world. Here’s why encryption is important to you:

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Sensitive Information:</strong> Encryption secures your personal details, such as your social security number, 
                                credit card information, and health records, from unauthorized access.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Mitigates Risks:</strong> In the event of a data breach, encrypted data is much harder for hackers 
                                to use. This means that even if your data is stolen, it remains encrypted and unusable without the proper 
                                decryption key.
                            </li>

                                <strong>Confidential Communication:</strong> Encryption keeps your emails, messages, and other 
                                communications private, ensuring that only the intended recipient can read them.
                            </li>

                <h2>Do the prefixes HTTP or HTTPS matter when we're talking about secure websites?</h2>
                <p>
                    Yes, the prefixes HTTP and HTTPS are crucial when discussing secure websites, and they indicate different levels 
                    of security for web communications.

                <h2>What is an SSL certificate authority?</h2>
                <p>
                    An SSL Certificate Authority (CA) is an organization that issues digital certificates used to secure communications 
                    over the internet.
